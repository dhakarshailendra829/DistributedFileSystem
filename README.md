Project Title:- Distributed File System with Fault Tolerance


Introduction:- A Distributed File System (DFS) with Fault Tolerance is designed to efficiently 
store and retrieve data across multiple networked nodes while ensuring system reliability 
and data availability even in the presence of failures.This system plays a crucial role 
in large-scale computing environments, cloud storage solutions, and enterprise applications.


Key Features:- 1.	Data Replication: The system maintains multiple copies of data across different nodes to prevent loss due to hardware or network failures.
2.	Failure Detection and Recovery: Continuous monitoring of nodes allows the system to detect failures and redirect requests to healthy nodes.
3.	Load Balancing: Ensures even distribution of data and traffic across all available nodes, preventing bottlenecks.
4.	Consistency and Data Integrity: Uses efficient mechanisms to ensure that all copies of the data remain synchronized.
5.	Scalability: The system can dynamically add or remove nodes without disrupting ongoing operations.
6.	Efficient Data Management: Supports large-scale data processing and retrieval with minimal latency.


System Architecture:- 1.    Client Nodes: Users or applications that request file storage and retrieval.
2.    Master Node: Maintains metadata (file locations, node status) and manages overall system health.
3.    Storage Nodes: Store actual file chunks and ensure replication and fault tolerance.
4.    Monitoring & Fault Handling Mechanisms: Continuously track system performance and trigger recovery when failures occur.


Work-Flow:- 1. Client requests data storage or retrieval.
2. Master Node processes the request and assigns storage nodes.
3. Data is split into chunks and distributed across multiple storage nodes.
4. Replication ensures fault tolerance by keeping multiple copies of each chunk.
5. If a node fails, the system redirects requests to a replica.
6. A recovery process is initiated to replace lost data and restore redundancy.


Module-Wise Breakdown:-(A). Client Module:- The Client Module is responsible for providing users with an interface to interact with the
Distributed File System (DFS). It handles file operations, communicates with the Master Node, and ensures fault tolerance in case of failures.
Functions:
•	File Upload: Splits large files into chunks and sends them to the Master Node for storage allocation.
•	File Download: Requests file chunks from the Master Node and reconstructs them into a complete file.
•	File Management: Allows users to rename, delete, or move files within the DFS.
•	Failure Handling: If a request fails due to a network issue or node failure, it automatically retries the operation.
(B). Master Node (Metadata Manager) Module:- The Master Node acts as the central controller, managing file metadata, storage locations, and system health.
Functions:
•	Metadata Management: Keeps a record of file locations, sizes, access permissions, and timestamps.
•	Storage Node Tracking: Monitors the availability and performance of storage nodes.
•	File Allocation: Decides where new file chunks should be stored based on load balancing and fault tolerance policies.
•	Data Consistency: Ensures that replicated data remains synchronized across multiple nodes.
(C). Storage Node Module:- Storage Nodes store actual file chunks and manage replication, retrieval, and fault tolerance.
Functions:
•	Chunk Storage: Stores file chunks assigned by the Master Node.
•	Data Replication: Maintains multiple copies of data for fault tolerance.
•	Health Monitoring: Sends periodic status reports to the Master Node.
•	Failure Recovery: If a storage node fails, other nodes rebuild the missing data from replicas.
(D). Replication & Fault Tolerance Module:- This module ensures data availability by storing multiple copies of file chunks across different storage nodes.
Functions:
•	Data Replication: Uses a replication factor (e.g., 3 copies per file chunk) to ensure redundancy.
•	Heartbeat Mechanism: Periodically checks if storage nodes are alive.
•	Automatic Data Reallocation: If a node fails, the system reallocates data to another node.
•	Erasure Coding: Uses mathematical techniques to reconstruct lost data with minimal storage overhead.
(E). Load Balancing Module:- To avoid bottlenecks, this module distributes file storage and access requests efficiently across nodes.
Functions:
•	Dynamic File Distribution: Ensures that files are evenly spread across all storage nodes.
•	Request Allocation: Directs read/write requests to underutilized nodes to prevent congestion.
•	Resource Optimization: Monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage to balance workloads dynamically.
(F). Failure Detection & Recovery Module:- This module monitors the system for failures and automatically recovers lost data.
Functions:
•	Health Monitoring: Uses heartbeat signals to check storage node availability.
•	Failure Detection: If a node stops responding, it is marked as failed and removed from the active list.
•	Data Recovery: If a failure occurs, the system reconstructs lost data using replicas or erasure coding.
•	Client Request Redirection: If a node fails, client requests are redirected to another available node.
(G). Security & Access Control Module:- This module ensures data protection by implementing authentication, encryption, and permission management.
Functions:
•	User Authentication: Uses password-based login, tokens, or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
•	File Permissions: Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access.
•	Data Encryption: Ensures files are encrypted during storage and transmission.
•	Intrusion Detection: Detects unauthorized access attempts and logs security breaches.
(H). Monitoring & Logging Module:- This module helps track system performance, identify issues, and generate alerts in case of failures.
Functions:
•	System Logs: Records all file operations, node failures, and recovery actions.
•	Real-time Monitoring: Provides a dashboard to monitor file transfers, system health, and storage usage.
•	Failure Alerts: Sends notifications when critical issues are detected.
•	Performance Analysis: Helps administrators optimize system performance by analyzing log data.
